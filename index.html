                Welcome to My Taylor Swift Opinions That You Never Knew You Needed! I made this website for two equally important reasons. The first reason is that for REL 503 I had to build a webpage using my new html and css skills. The second (and secretly more important) reason is that I have a lot of really good opinions about Taylor Swift and her music that the world needs to hear! Below you will find wonderful examples of my coding abilities and also all of my  thoughts, theories, and opinions on all things Miss Taylor Alison Swift. Are you ready for it?

        <h2>
            Taylor Swift is the Music Industry
        </h2>

            <p class="music_industry">
                We all know Taylor Swift from her hits like Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake It Off, and more, but her contribution to pop culture has been astronomical. Winning a total of 431 awards including 11 Grammys, 11 MTV VMAs, 12 CMAs, 25 Billboard Music Awards, and 32 AMAs (making her the most awarded artist in AMA history). In 2021, Taylor Swift made history by becoming the first female artist to win "Album of the Year" 3 times when <em>folklore</em> joined <em>Fearless</em> and <em>1989</em>. Taylor Swift really is the music industry! But don't just take my word for it...

        <h2>
            My Favorite Taylor Swift Album
        </h2>

            <p class="fav_album">
                All 9 of Taylor Swift's albums offer something special. 1989 has bop after bop, Fearless has the country storytelling, folklore is one of a kind (well, until evermore came around). But there is one album that will always be my favorite: Lover. 
            </p>

            <figure>

            <p>
                Lover is my absolute favorite Taylor Swift album for so many reasons! To start, Lover was the album that made me a Swiftie. I knew Taylor Swift's music before, but never spent much time caring about it or going out of my way to listen to it before this album. When Lover came out, I spent almost all of my time listening to it on repeat – so much so that even though it didn't come out until August of 2019, it dominated my Spotify Wrapped! 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Lover era was cut short by the surprise release of folklore less than a year after Lover's release, so it is often overlooked by most fans. Most people talk about Lover as an album for happy people because of songs like ME! and Paper Rings, but the album offers so much more. The entire album offers the wide range of emotions that come with love, so of course there are the fun songs that portray happiness, but it offers songs like Death By A Thousand Cuts and The Archer that hit a sadder and more complex set of emotions. And not to mention Soon You’ll Get Better, a song so sad Taylor won’t perform it live! 
            </p>

            <p>
                All in all, Lover provides a wide range of emotions with a complex pop sound and lyrical masterpieces. And, if that's not enough for you, Lover marked the first album that Taylor owned. This album is a special album and will always be my favorite!

                The Best Taylor Swift Album
        </h2>
    
                <p class="best_album">
                    While Lover is my favorite album, there is another album that I think is objectively her best album: 1989.
                </p>

                <p>
                    1989 changed the game for Taylor's sound and marked an overwhelmingly successful transition into pop music. The songs on 1989 have a maturity that the four prior albums didn't have, and all of the songs are exceedingly well written. It is one of my two "no skip" albums of hers (the other being evermore), meaning that I never skip a song on 1989 because they are all that good. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Taylor Swift is known for her lyrics and has always been an amazing lyricist, but the lyrics on 1989 are something different. They moved from the pretty, country storytelling style the first four albums had to the clever wordsmithing all of her albums since have maintained. And of course, we can't forget that 1989 swept the Grammys the year it was out. 1989 is a truly fantastic album that deserves all of the hype it has received and continues to receive. I can't wait to see what the re-recording offers because I know the Out of the Vault tracks are going to be great!

        <h2>
            Theory about songs referencing and predicting albums
        </h2>

            <p class="album_theory">
                As I've listened to Taylor Swift's discography over and over, I began noticing a trend. Each album has a song that sounds like it belongs on the album that came out next, meaning that a song on Fearless sounds more like Speak Now, Speak Now has a song that sounds more like Red, and so on. When I noticed this, I went through and found all of the songs that predicted the era that followed. With evermore being the newest album, I picked the song that I think predicts what TS10 (Taylor Swift's 10th album) will sound like. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Debut predicting Fearless: Teardrops on my Guitar</li>
                <li>Fearless predicting Speak Now: Forever and Always</li>
                <li>Speak Now predicting Red: Dear John</li>
                <li>Red predicting 1989: State of Grace</li>
                <li>1989 predicting reputation: I Know Places</li>
                <li>reputation predicting Lover: New Year’s Day</li>
                <li>Lover predicting folklore: It’s Nice To Have A Friend</li>
                <li>folklore predicting evermore: peace</li>
                <li>evermore predicting TS10: closure</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>
            5 Lyrics That Prove Taylor Swift is the Best Lyricist of All Time
        </h2>

            <p class=best_lyrics>
                Here are 5 of Taylor Swift's best lyrics that really show her poetic genius:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>“I want auroras and sad prose. I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet because I haven't moved in years, and I want you right here.” – the lakes</li>
                <li>“Your Midas touch on the Chevy door, November flush and your flannel cure.” – champagne problems</li>
                <li>“So you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong. We learned to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts.” – State of Grace</li>
                <li>“The ties were black, the lies were white. In shades of grey, in candlelight, I wanted to leave him. I needed a reason.” – Getaway Car</li>
                <li>“And you call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest. I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here, and I remember it all too well.” – All Too Well</li>
            </ul>
