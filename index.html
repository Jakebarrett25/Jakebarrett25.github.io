                Welcome to My Taylor Swift Opinions That You Never Knew You Needed! I made this website for two equally important reasons. The first reason is that for REL 503 I had to build a webpage using my new html and css skills. The second (and secretly more important) reason is that I have a lot of really good opinions about Taylor Swift and her music that the world needs to hear! Below you will find wonderful examples of my coding abilities and also all of my  thoughts, theories, and opinions on all things Miss Taylor Alison Swift. Are you ready for it?
