            <p class="welcome">
                Welcome to My Taylor Swift Opinions That You Never Knew You Needed! I made this website for two equally important reasons. The first reason is that for REL 503 I had to build a webpage using my new html and css skills. The second (and secretly more important) reason is that I have a lot of really good opinions about Taylor Swift and her music that the world needs to hear! Below you will find wonderful examples of my coding abilities and also all of my  thoughts, theories, and opinions on all things Miss Taylor Alison Swift. Are you ready for it?

        <h2>
            Taylor Swift is the Music Industry
        </h2>

            <p class="music_industry">
                We all know Taylor Swift from her hits like Love Story, You Belong With Me, Shake It Off, and more, but her contribution to pop culture has been astronomical. Winning a total of 431 awards including 11 Grammys, 11 MTV VMAs, 12 CMAs, 25 Billboard Music Awards, and 32 AMAs (making her the most awarded artist in AMA history). In 2021, Taylor Swift made history by becoming the first female artist to win "Album of the Year" 3 times when <em>folklore</em> joined <em>Fearless</em> and <em>1989</em>. Taylor Swift really is the music industry! But don't just take my word for it...
